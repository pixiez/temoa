This branch, elastic_demand, is the "main" branch of this fork of the  Temoa
Project. This branch implements the elastic demand version of a MARKAL type models.

See Section 1.6 of http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/MrklDoc-I_StdMARKAL.pdf.

Note that the branch energysystem in the "main" branch of main repository:

https://github.com/hunteke/temoa
https://github.com/hunteke/temoa.git


TRY:

python price_generator.py ../data_files/utopia-exp.dat --solver cbc
python elastic_model_script.py ../data_files/utopia-exp.dat ./price.dat  --solver cbc

NOTE: The solver should return duals.

Please read README.txt before reading this.

Compared to the branch energysystem this branch, elastic_demand, contains the following new files:

1. utils.py
utils.py has a new results_writer function that we use.

2. temoa_elastic_model.py
temoa_elastic_model.py contains the elastic demand version of the temoa model. Demand 
is now a variable which is determined by maximizing the total welfare: 

Consumer costs - Producer costs.

3. temoa_elastic_rules.py
temoa_elastic_rules.py has additional rules/functions for the elastic version of the 
temoa model.

4. price_generator.py
This is a script to obtain price data for a reference demand.
The price data are obtained from the duals of the constraint, DemandConstraint.
The elasticities are exogenous, and are supplied in this script. The search range for the 
variable V_Demand, (MinDemand, MaxDemand) is determined using a parameter, DEMAND_RANGE. 
The Price, MinDemand and MaxDemand are written to the file, price.dat.

5. price.dat
Ouput of the price_generator.py script.

6. elastic_model_script.py
Solves for variable demand using the elastic demand version of temoa in temoa_elastic_model.py.
